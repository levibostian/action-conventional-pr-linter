**Hey, there @{author} ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–. I'm a bot here to help you.**

This project uses a special format for pull requests titles. Don't worry, it's easy!

This pull request title should be in this format:

```
<type>: short description of change being made
```

**If your pull request introduces breaking changes** to the code, use this format:

```
<type>!: short description of breaking change
```

where `<type>` is one of the following:

- `feat:` - A new feature is being added by this pull request.
- `fix:` - A bug is being fixed by this pull request.
- `docs:` - This pull request is making documentation changes, only.
- `refactor:` - A change was made that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature.
- `test:` - Adds missing tests or fixes broken tests.
- `style:` - Changes that do not effect the code (whitespace, linting, formatting, semi-colons, etc)
- `perf:` - Changes improve performance of the code.

- `build:` - Changes to the build system (maven, npm, gulp, etc)
- `ci:` - Changes to the CI build system (Travis, GitHub Actions, Circle, etc)

- `chore:` - Other changes to project that don't modify source code or test files.
- `revert:` - Reverts a previous commit that was made.

**Note:** If your pull request does multiple things such as adding a feature _and_ makes changes to the CI server _and_ fixes some bugs then you might want to consider splitting this pull request up into multiple smaller pull requests.
