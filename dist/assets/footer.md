This project uses a special format for pull requests titles. Don't worry, it's easy!

This pull request title should be in this format:

```
<type>: short description of change being made
```

**If your pull request [introduces breaking changes](https://web.archive.org/web/20220725195319/https://nordicapis.com/what-are-breaking-changes-and-how-do-you-avoid-them/)** to the code, use this format:

```
<type>!: short description of breaking change
```

where `<type>` is one of the following:

- `feat:` - A feature is being added or modified by this pull request. Use this if you made any changes to any of the features of the project.
- `fix:` - A bug is being fixed by this pull request. Use this if you made any fixes to bugs in the project. 

- `docs:` - This pull request is making documentation changes, only.
- `refactor:` - A change was made that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature.
- `test:` - Adds missing tests or fixes broken tests.
- `style:` - Changes that do not effect the code (whitespace, linting, formatting, semi-colons, etc)
- `perf:` - Changes improve performance of the code.

- `build:` - Changes to the build system (maven, npm, gulp, etc)
- `ci:` - Changes to the CI build system (Travis, GitHub Actions, Circle, etc)

- `chore:` - Other changes to project that don't modify source code or test files.
- `revert:` - Reverts a previous commit that was made.


### Examples:
```
feat: edit profile photo
refactor!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints
build: update npm dependencies
style: run formatter 
```

Need more examples? Want to learn more about this format? [Check out the official docs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

**Note:** If your pull request does multiple things such as adding a feature _and_ makes changes to the CI server _and_ fixes some bugs then you might want to consider splitting this pull request up into multiple smaller pull requests.
